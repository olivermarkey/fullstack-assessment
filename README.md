# Full-Stack Application Assessment

This repo contains a full-stack web app built with the following technologies:

## React Router V7 (Framework Mode)

[React Router V7](https://reactrouter.com/home) uses client side routing and LOADERS and ACTIONS for data fetching and mutations. Framework mode comes with vite installed from bundling and transpiling.

## Mantine

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is a front end component library which uses postcss for styling.

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to containerize both the react application and the postgres database for deployment.

## PostgreSQL

A containerized [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with a schema and seeding.
NOTE: The current postgres scripts do not save a volume locally. This means that if the container is deleted all data is lost. This should not be used in production.

## PostgREST

## AWS Cognito

## AG Grid

## System Architecture
